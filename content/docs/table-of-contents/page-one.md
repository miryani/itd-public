# ITD Page One

Welcome to "Page One", a brief guide to getting started with the many technologies and tools available to you at DMD.

This guide is provided by the DMD IT & DevOps team, or ITD for short. There are many other training and how-to guides available to you, but this should get you up and running as quickly as possible, and then point you to the resources available for further information.

## 1. Page One

To get started with this guide, you should have your **DMD credentials**. If you do not have your domain credentials (a DMD email address and a password) you should [contact ITD]({{< ref "contact-itd.md" >}}) or your hiring manager before going any further.

This guide will focus on three main areas:

1. Passwords and authentication
2. Communication tools
3. Information resources and getting help

These three areas are of interest to all DMD staff, but there may be other tools and services specific to your team or job function that will not be covered here. Your team lead, manager or supervisor will help you with those.

It's important to note that there are many and varied tools used here at DMD, and it will take some time to familiarize yourself with them. To help you, DMD provides a series of training videos on the "Docebo" web site. If you have not already received your Docebo information, please see your hiring manager. You should spend some time reviewing the Docebo videos, as it will help you with both your onboarding and your day to day work.

## 2. Passwords and Authentication

### 2.1. Single Sign On with Okta

The first thing to know about passwords and getting access to DMD resources is that we make extensive use of "Single Sign On" (SSO), which allows us to have one set of credentials for most DMD tools and services. There are exceptions - some products and tools used by DMD do not support SSO. Unfortunately, for those you will have a separate set of credentials. You'll learn about that later.

The SSO tool used by DMD is called "Okta", and it also gives you a convenient web portal through which you can access just about all of the cloud-based or web-based tools available to you at DMD.

The password provided to you by ITD is your SSO password, also referred to as your "domain password",

You can visit the Okta portal using any web browser, at:

https://dmdconnects.okta.com

When you log in to Okta, you'll be on the "Okta Home Page". Here you may see a number of "tiles" or shortcuts to various apps and tools that you can use. Continue following this guide to see some of the main ones, and you can explore the others later.

ITD staff will ask you to change your password after your first login.

## 3. Communication Tools

The main tools we'll cover here are:

1. Email : your "@dmdconnects.com" email address
2. Slack : for instant messaging
3. Zoom : Audio and video conferencing

### 3.1. Email

DMD uses Microsoft Exchange for email. You can connect to the email servers using just about any mail client, but most people choose Microsoft Outlook. The Outlook client software should already be installed for you if you have a DMD-provided computer, and pre-configured for you to use. All you have to do is double-click the icon or shortcut.

You can also use "Outlook Web Access" (OWA) to read your mail from any web browser. You should see a link to Outlook Web Access in your Okta home page.

In addition, mobile operating systems (Android and iOS) have Outlook apps that will allow you to read your mail from your smartphone. Instructions and training videos for all of these are available to you, see the links at the end of this document.

### 3.2. Slack

For instant messaging, we use Slack, a popular web-based chat.

A Slack desktop client should be pre-installed on your DMD-provided computer. Simply double-click the icon to start up Slack.

You can also log in to Slack through the Okta portal, or directly with your web browser at

https://dmdconnects.slack.com

### 3.3. Zoom

Zoom is an audio and video conferencing tool, used widely at DMD, especially since remote work is quite commonplace.

A Zoom client may be installed on your DMD-provided computer.

You can also connect directly through the app in the Okta portal, or with your web browser, at:

https://dmdconnects.zoom.us
